![design image](./public/ReadmeImg.png)

This project was developed as part of a web development bootcamp. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app allows users to organize the tasks they need to complete throughout the day. As each task is completed, a visual progress bar updates to show overall progress, helping users stay focused and motivated. Itâ€™s an ideal tool for anyone looking to manage their time efficiently and achieve their daily goals.
